# AI Prompts Used

These are the core prompts used to build the logic and integrate advanced features for the CoverCraftAI:

1. "Create a professional career dashboard UI using Tailwind CSS. I want a glassmorphism effect, a form on the left for user details, and a preview section on the right for the generated letter."

2. "How to use Multer in Node.js to handle PDF uploads in memory? I need to extract text from the buffer using pdf-parse without saving the file on the disk."

3. "I am getting an error ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED with the pdf-parse library in Node.js. Is there a fix or an alternative library I can use for ESM?"

4. "Gemini API is giving a 404 error saying the model is not found. How do I change the API version to v1 and what is the correct model name to use?"

5. "How to send a FormData object containing text fields and a PDF file from the frontend to a Node.js backend using the Fetch API?"

6. "Write a system prompt for Gemini that reads resume text and writes a professional cover letter. Make sure the output is plain text only—no markdown, no bold stars (*), and no symbols."

7. "How to show a shimmer loading effect or a spinner in the UI while waiting for the AI response to make the app look better?"
